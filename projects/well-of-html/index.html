        <h1>Sean Connery <small>1962-1967, 1971</small>
            <p>Scottish actor Sean Connery was the first actor to portry Ian Fleming's James Bond 007. He started with
                the first film, <i>Dr. No</i>, in 1962. He followed that up with <i>From Russia With Love</i> (1963) and sent the 
                series <strong>into the stratosphere</strong> with 1964's <i>Goldfinger</i>. In 1965, <i>Thunderball</i> became the highest grossing
                film of the series and stayed there, when adjusted for inflation, until 2012. Connery followed that
                with a trip to Japan for <i>You Only Live Twice</i> (1967) based on a script by Roald Dahl. He officially
                retired from the role, but returned for the, then, unprecedented salary of <em>$1.25 million</em> for 1971's
                <i>Diamonds Are Forever</i>. He did return to the role of James Bond again in 1983 in non-EON Bond film: 
                <i>Never Say Never Again</i>.
            </p>
        </h1>
        <h2>George Lazenby <small>1969</small>
            <p>Australian actor George Lazenby turned in his one and only performance as James Bond in 1969's
                <i>On Her Majesty's Secret Service</i>. Despite being offered a 7 film deal, Lazenby walked away from the 
                role and being <b>black-listed</b> in Hollywood as a result.
            </p>
        </h2>
        <h3>Roger Moore <small>1973-1985</small>
            <p>Roger Moore took over the role of James Bond beginning with 1973's <i>Live and Let Die</i>>. He followed this 
                up with <i>The Man With The Golden Gun</i> (1974) and gave his best turn in this third outing in 1977 in 
                <i>The Spy Who Loved Me</i>. Following on from the success of <i>Star Wars</i>, Moore's fourth film is, to this day,
                <strong>the most over-the-top adventure in the canon </strong>as Bond traveled to space in <i>Moonraker</i> (1979). Bond 
                returned to Earth with a grounded adventure set primarily in Greece, in <i>For Your Eyes Only</i> (1981).
                Despite his desire to leave the role due to his age, he was 55 in 1983, Roger Moore was enticed back 
                by EON to combat Orion Pictures' rival Bond film with Sean Connery for the cold-war thriller, <i>Octopussy</i>
                (1983). Moore turned in his final performance in 1985's rather pedestrian <i>A View To A Kill</i> featuring
                Duran Duran's Billboard topping title track.
            </p>
        </h3>
        <h4>Timothy Dalton <small>1987-1989</small>
            <p>With Moore officially retiring and Pierce Brosnan being forced to pass on the role due to his TV 
                commitments, Welsh actor Timothy Dalton was cast. His portrayal was very different from Moore's, as his 
                Bond was much more brutal and cold. His initial film, <i>The Living Daylights</i> (1987) was the last film to 
                have a Fleming title until 2006. 1989's <i>Licence To Kill</i> became the lowest grossing film of the saga and 
                is, to this day, considered the most violent film of the series. Dalton retired from the role in 1994 
                as his third film lingered in <em>development hell</em> for 5 years.
            </p>
        </h4>
        <h5>Pierce Brosnan <small>1995-2002</small>
            <p>After accepting and then being forced to pass on the role of James Bond in 1986, Brosnan was officially 
                cast as James Bond in 1994. His first film ended a 6 year drought for the series. <i>Goldeneye</i> released 
                in 1995 and brought the series into a post-Soviet world. <i>Tomorrow Never Dies</i> (1997) introduced Bond 
                to the world of Fake News with a story that is oddly relevant in 2018. <i>The World Is Not Enough</i> (1999) 
                featured arguably the series's only female main villain. The Brosnan era was riding a high that the Bond 
                series had not seen <em>since the 70s</em>. However, all the good feeling was killed with 2002's abysmal entry, 
                <i>Die Another Day</i> (2002). Meant to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the release of the first film in the 
                series, the film was such a mess that production on Brosnan's fifth film was halted and he eventually left 
                the role before the release of the 21st film in the official series.
            </p>
        </h5>
        <h6>Daniel Craig <small>2006-</small>
            <p>Cast in 2005, Daniel Craig was initially met with resistance from fans and critics alike. Craig didn't fit 
                the picture of James Bond as Fleming wrote him. However, that all changed with the release of 2006's 
                reboot, <i>Casino Royale</i>. The film brought the film into the 21st century and reinvigorated the aging franchise. 
                2008's <i>Quantum of Solace</i> was a disappointing entry, playing to current trends (shaky cam, dark and gritty) 
                and was hurt by the 2007-08 writer's strike as the production began filming with an incomplete script. The 
                film entered another 4 year limbo during MGM's sale. <i>Skyfall</i> eventually released in 2012, coinciding with 50th 
                anniversary of the release of Dr. No, and became <em>the first and only Bond film to top $1 billion at the box office</em>. 
                The follow-up <i>Spectre</i> (2015) adapted the organization of <b>SPECTRE</b> to the modern-day and reintroduced Bond's 
                nemesis, Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Craig is set to return for at least one more film in 2019 with the currently untitled, 
                <i>Bond 25</i>.
